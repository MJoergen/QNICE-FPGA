; Classical "Hello World!" example for getting started coding
; QNICE assembler using the native toolchain: First, it prints "Hello World!"
; and then it counts from 1 to 10 and prints "Count #x", where x is decimal
; and goes from 1 to 10. So besides the simple "Hello World!" printing, this
; example also shows how to use "operating system" functions and how to do
; sub routine calls.
;
; While you are in the test_programs folder, enter the following line to
; compile and (if you are on a Mac) to automatically put the hello.out file
; into your clipboard so that you can directly copy/paste it to the Monitor
; using the M/L command. If you are on another OS, copy the hello.out file
; manually to your clipboard. Have a look at "README.md" in the main folder.

HARDWARE:

* SD Cards: Writing.

* SD Cards: Replace SPI access by native access and by doing so, achieve
  a 100% compatible and reliable system for SD, SDHC, SDCX.

* Research, if the asynchronous RAM (flip flops) for the register banks can
  be replaced by synchronous RAM (Block RAM) without increasing the amount
  of CPU cycles per instruction.

* Refactor MMIO for not having so many comperators: use only one register
  output and link it to all devices; use a smart subtraction to find out
  registers and drastically shorten the code.

* Shrink the ROM, currently we could go from 0x0000 to 0x1FFF and still have
  plenty of room left and let programs start at 0x2000, instead of as this
  is the case today, from 0x8000 on.

* Think about advantages/disadvantages of removing ROM and replacing it by
  prefilled RAM (could lead to very hard to debug effects, if some renegade
  program overwrites "operating system" areas). On the other hand, we could
  do it in a way, that after a RESET, the Monitor RAM area is re-filled from
  a ROM.

* Get rid of hardcoded clock speed dependencies:
  + Have a global constant that reflects the speed of the board and refactor
  all hardcoded frequencies to be dependend formulas from this speed
  (e.g. UART, SD card, VGA, debouncer, SD$TIMEOUT_HIGH, etc.)
  + Have a generator that generates the speeds that certain components need
  as input, e.g. the SD Card component needs currently hardcoded 25 MHz
  + Keyboard: remove hardcoded 18000 constant
  + Monitor: gets hardcoded 10000 clock cycles => 2.000 "nop" loops

* Improve design to support 100 MHz
  + EAE might need the busy flag then (currently the combinatorial net
    for div and mod takes about 30ns to execute, therefore it is buffered
    in the FF "res")

* Add pipelining to the CPU
  + Create a comprehensive CPU testsuite first
  + Create comprehensive measurement mechanisms first, so that we can
    measure the speedup ("before/after")

* PS/2: Refactor scancode conversion to be more table/ROM like and less
  like a huge array of multiplexers

* Refactor TIL and TIL Mask to support 8 digits / 32 bits

* VGA being able to report the vertical retrace for flicker-free graphics,
  e.g. for being able to enhance Q-TRIS to work double-buffered and to
  switch buffers during retrace. And/or for having a good general sync.
  mechanism. To "report" via register and/or interrupt.

* VGA: support a text mode with colors

* VGA: support a graphics mode with colors

* Debugging mechanisms (e.g. single-step mode in hardware), which do not
  necessarily need a fully fledged interrupt system

* Memory management unit (more than 64kWords of RAM/ROM, pages, etc.)

* Interrupt system (how do we handle I/O, which is full of atomic operations?
  add ideas of how to do it from the e-mail conversations to an ideas file
  somewhere in the doc folder)


MEGA65 HARDWARE:

* Support both SD card slots. In a step one, we could implement a similar
  smart switching mechanism than the MEGA65, so it would be a hardware-only
  feature. Later, we could support two SD cards simultaneously, but this would
  need a Monitor enhancement.

* Support HDMI

* Support somehow this mega cool floppy drive


MONITOR:

* variables.asm: replace hardcoded blocksize for _SD$DEVICEHANDLE by using
  FAT32$DEV_STRUCT_SIZE

* Get rid of the hardcoded keyboard locale

* BS/DEL when entering hex digits (and at other reasonable places)

* Use HW debugging mechanisms to offer single step debugging


ASSEMBLER STANDARD LIBs (WITHIN MONITOR):

* Add writing to SD card support / FAT32 support

* Finalize 32 bit arithmetic (muls32, divs32)

* String libraries: Switchable locales? UTF8 support?
  (Or - as an alternative to this fully fledged solution: Can we implement a
  workaround that kind of works most of the time? E.g. a translation mechanism
  that checks STDIN/STDOUT and acts accordingly, e.g.
  if STDIN=UART and BS is pressed, then assume UTF-8, but if STDIN=USB and
  BS is pressed, then assume 8859-15? And similar behaviour for
  non-ASCII chars like "Ã¤"? Mapping depending on STDIN/STDOUT combinations?
  And always storing single-byte characters? That would mean, that we e.g.
  translate some selected chars from UTF-8 to 8859-15 while entering them
  via STDIN=UART. More thoughts to be invested here.)

* Floating point support (in software? or in hardware? or only in the C lib
  and not at all on the monitor's level?)


EMULATOR:

* Use defines from ../dist_kit/sysdef.h instead of redefining them in qnice.c

* Test, if compilation and running works under Linux (e.g. Ubuntu)

* Test, if compilation and running works under Windows

* Emulate all VGA register commands

* WASM: Investigate if switching the WebGL context to high performance mode
  makes sense; currently we run on the low performance mode on most browsers,
  which means on Mac Books that the low performance GPU is used. Currently it
  looks like this works absolutely well enough, but nevertheless investigating
  this topic might be worth a try.
  + Reference Emscripten Changelog.md: 1.39.9 searcch for #10505
  + https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/
    and search for "powerPreference"

* macOS only: Make file option for creating a installable/clickable Mac
  executable (learn how to do that first and also how to sign). Maybe the
  demo disk image from qnice-fpga.com should also be mounted there by default
  (but still other images should be mountable, too)

* U.S. keyboard support

* Homogeneous code style like vaxmans original style
  (pointers, indentation, etc.) => try to find and use a coding style
  modification tool and throughly check that no bugs are introduced

* Better support for window resizing: offer some presets incl. aspect ratios
  (see above) using Q> commands and maybe additionally also using ALT+<key>
  combinations or a small "windowed menu" building on the speed regulator
  window "system" . Optionally, as a bonus: Research menu items in SDL and
  offer this via menus (seems to need very platformm specific code;
  plugins/open source available?) 

* Improve the Full Screen mode by allowing various aspect ratios such as
  1.8:1 which is optimal for Q-TRIS, or standards like 4:3 and 16:9.

* Support High-DPI Mode (needs to be signed on Mac?)


NATIVE TOOLCHAIN: ASSEMBLER:

* Get rid of hardcoded gcc in the assembler/asm script for precompiling.
  Use tools/detect.include. But this needs thorough testing, if for example
  the precompiler invokation works the same in clang vs. gcc.


VBCC TOOLCHAIN: C COMPILER:

* check/validate correct register bank usage

* Function entry points: remove superflous register MOVEs

* Optimization: Correct "costs", so that e.g. in -O3 constants are
  loaded in to registers in a loop instead of e.g doing SUB 1, @R1++

* code generation for 16bit multiplication: EAE wait code as soon as necessary
  (currently no wait code is being generated, maybe this becomes necessary
  when we switch to 100 MHz)


VBCC TOOLCHAIN: C STANDARD LIB:

* Add support for float and double

* Enhance mul32_div32.c by testing much more cases for the 32bit
  multiplication, because the new _lmul.s has not been thoroughly tested,
  yet. Also test signed and unsigned.

* Replace more 32bit math functions (div, mod, shl, shr) by faster assembler
  versions. When doing div and mod, optimize by using static variables
  that check the latest parameters and optimize mod (because the 32bit
  div routine generates also the mode). But this would not be threadsafe.


VBCC TOOLCHAIN: MONITOR-LIB:

* Rewrite in pure assembler to avoid overhead.

* Add all meaningful monitor functions.


DEMOS:

* Basic Interpreter

* Forth Interpreter

* VGA Textmode games: BreakOut, Snake, Pac Man, 2048


DOCUMENTATION:

* Add the PDF or HTML documentation version of the VBCC toolchain.
